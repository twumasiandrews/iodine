/* Ringbuffer Query Handling (qmem) and DNS Cache:
   This is used to make the handling duplicates and query timeouts simpler
   and all handled in one place.
   Using this, lazy mode is possible with n queries (n <= windowsize)

   New queries are placed consecutively in the buffer, replacing any old
   queries (already responded to) if length == QMEM_LEN. Old queries are kept
   as a record for duplicate requests. If a dupe is found and USE_DNSCACHE is
   defined, the previous answer is sent (if it exists), otherwise an invalid
   response is sent.

   On the DNS cache:
   This cache is implemented to better handle the aggressively impatient DNS
   servers that very quickly re-send requests when we choose to not
   immediately answer them in lazy mode. This cache works much better than
   pruning(=dropping) the improper requests, since the DNS server will
   actually get an answer instead of silence.

   Because of the CMC in both ping and upstream data, unwanted cache hits
   are prevented. Due to the combination of CMC and varying sequence IDs, it
   is extremely unlikely that any duplicate answers will be incorrectly sent
   during a session (given QMEM_LEN is not very large). */
